 *	This class is used to track a property that is marked to be replicated for the lifetime of the actor channel.
 *  This doesn't mean the property will necessarily always be replicated; it just means:
 *	"check this property for replication for the life of the actor; and I don't want to think about it anymore"
 *  A secondary condition can also be used to skip replication based on the condition results
