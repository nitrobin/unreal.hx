  The canvas panel is a designer friendly panel that allows widgets to be laid out at arbitrary
  locations, anchored and z-ordered with other children of the canvas.  The canvas is a great widget
  for manual layout, but bad when you want to procedurally just generate widgets and place them in a
  container (unless you want absolute layout).
