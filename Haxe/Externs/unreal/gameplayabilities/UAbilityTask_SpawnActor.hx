/**
  WARNING: This type was defined as MinimalAPI on its declaration. Because of that, its properties/methods are inaccessible
  
  Convenience task for spawning actors on the network authority. If not the net authority, we will not spawn and Success will not be called.
  The nice thing this adds is the ability to modify expose on spawn properties while also implicitly checking network role before spawning.
  
  Though this task doesn't do much - games can implement similiar tasks that carry out game specific rules. For example a 'SpawnProjectile'
  task that limits the available classes to the games projectile class, and that does game specific stuff on spawn (for example, determining
  firing position from a weapon attachment - logic that we don't necessarily want in ability blueprints).
  
  Long term we can also use this task as a sync point. If the executing client could wait execution until the server creates and replicate sthe
  actor down to him. We could potentially also use this to do predictive actor spawning / reconciliation.
