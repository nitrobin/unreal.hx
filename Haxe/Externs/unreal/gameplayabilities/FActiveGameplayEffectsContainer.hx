/**
  Active GameplayEffects Container
      -Bucket of ActiveGameplayEffects
      -Needed for FFastArraySerialization
  
  This should only be used by UAbilitySystemComponent. All of this could just live in UAbilitySystemComponent except that we need a distinct USTRUCT to implement FFastArraySerializer.
  
  The preferred way to iterate through the ActiveGameplayEffectContainer is with CreateConstITerator/CreateIterator or stl style range iteration:
  
  
      for (const FActiveGameplayEffect& Effect : this)
      {
      }
  
      for (auto It = CreateConstIterator(); It; ++It)
      {
      }
