/**
  WARNING: This type was not defined as DLL export on its declaration. Because of that, its properties/methods are inaccessible
  
  The idea here is that UGameplayEffectTemplates are templates created by system designers for commonly used
  GameplayEffects. For example: StandardPhysicalDamage, StandardSnare, etc.
  
  This allows for A) Less experienced designers to create new ones based on the templates B) Easier/quicker creation
  of GameplayEffects: don't have to worry about forgeting a tag or stacking rule, etc.
  
  The template provides:
          -Default values
          -What properties are editable by default
  
  Default values are simply the default values of the UGameplayEffectTemplate (since it is a UGameplayEffect). Whatever values
  are different than CDO values will be copied over when making a new GameplayEffect from a template.
  
  EditableProperties describes what properties should be exposed by default when editing a templated gameplayeffect. This is just
  a string list. Properties whose name match strings in that list will be shown, the rest will be hidden. All properties can always be
  seen/edited by just checking "ShowAllProperties" on the GameplayEffect itself.
