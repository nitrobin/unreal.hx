  Struct used to define information for terminal types, e.g. types that can be contained
  by a container. Currently can represent strong/weak references to a type (only UObjects),
  a structure, or a primitive. Support for "Container of Containers" is done by wrapping
  a structure, rather than implicitly defining names for containers.
