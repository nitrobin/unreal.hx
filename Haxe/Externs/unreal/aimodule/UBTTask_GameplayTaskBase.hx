  Base class for managing gameplay tasks
  Since AITask doesn't have any kind of success/failed results, default implemenation will only return EBTNode::Succeeded
  
  In your ExecuteTask:
  - use NewBTAITask() helper to create task
  - initialize task with values if needed
  - use StartGameplayTask() helper to execute and get node result
