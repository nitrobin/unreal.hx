/**
  A PlayerCameraManager is responsible for managing the camera for a particular
  player. It defines the final view properties used by other systems (e.g. the renderer),
  meaning you can think of it as your virtual eyeball in the world. It can compute the
  final camera properties directly, or it can arbitrate/blend between other objects or
  actors that influence the camera (e.g. blending from one CameraActor to another).
  
  The PlayerCameraManagers primary external responsibility is to reliably respond to
  various Get*() functions, such as GetCameraViewPoint. Most everything else is
  implementation detail and overrideable by user projects.
  
  By default, a PlayerCameraManager maintains a "view target", which is the primary actor
  the camera is associated with. It can also apply various "post" effects to the final
  view state, such as camera animations, shakes, post-process effects or special
  effects such as dirt on the lens.
